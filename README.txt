Word Thesaurus

Looking for more ways to express the same things that you always end up saying?
Well, look no further. This thesaurus will help you with your rheorical skills. Simply type a word and all kinds of synonyms and antonyms will print out. After that, just gracefully apply them to your arguments, and the world will be at your feet.

If you intend to use it, keep in mind that you will need to add an api key since I took mine out. 

This exercise was part of a GDI workshop where we got to brush up on our json and ajax.
